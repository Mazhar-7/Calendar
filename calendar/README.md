# Calendar App

This project is a minimal setup to get React working with Vite, including hot module replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules. It's a simple calendar application built using modern front-end technologies.

## Features

- **React**: Fast and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: Next-generation front-end tooling that is fast and efficient.
- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality and consistency with predefined rules.
